A. Derivation of the Einstein–Berard Relation
The matter Lagrangian includes a resonance‑dependent effective mass term

𝐿
𝑚

−
𝑚
e
f
f
(
𝜙
)

,
with

𝑚
e
f
f
(
𝜙
)
=
𝑚
 
𝐵
𝐶

(
𝜙

𝜙
)
2
.
For a particle at rest in a homogeneous background, the rest energy is

𝐸
=
𝑚
e
f
f
(
𝜙
)
.
Using the Resonance Invariant 
𝑆
0
=
𝜙
/
𝜙
0
, we obtain

𝐸
=
𝑚
(
𝐵
𝐶
2
)
𝑆
0
−
2
,
which is the Einstein–Berard relation.
In the present vacuum (
𝑆
0
=
1
), this reduces to a simple rescaling of inertial mass by 
𝐵
𝐶
2
.

B. Linearized Perturbations and the 0.10 Hz Stability Well
Expanding the scalar field around its vacuum value,

𝜙
(
𝑥
)
=
𝜙
0
+
𝛿
𝜙
(
𝑥
)
,
and expanding the potential

𝑉
(
𝜙
)
=

(
𝜙

𝜙

)

to quadratic order yields

𝑉
(
𝜙
)
≃

𝑚
𝜙

(

.
Neglecting matter backreaction, the field equation becomes

Spatially homogeneous perturbations satisfy

𝜔

𝜙
=

𝑓

,
giving a vacuum resonance frequency

𝑓

This defines the Stability Well: a genuine small‑oscillation mode of the resonance field.

C. Cosmological Background Equations
In a spatially flat FRW background with scale factor 
𝑎
(
𝑡
)
, the Friedmann equation becomes

𝐻
2
=
8
𝜋
𝐺
3
[
𝜌
e
f
f
+
𝜌
𝜙
]
,
where

𝜌

f

𝐶

,
𝜌
𝜙
=

𝜙
˙

𝑉
(
𝜙
)
.
The scalar‑field equation reduces to

𝜙
¨
+
3
𝐻
𝜙
˙
+
𝑚
𝜙
2
(
𝜙
−
𝜙
0
)
=
−
∂
𝐿
𝑚
∂
𝜙
.
In the vacuum‑dominated regime (
𝜌
→
0
, 
𝜙
→
𝜙
0
), standard FRW dynamics is recovered.
Deviations in 
𝜙
 generate the resonance‑based corrections discussed in the main text.

D. Dimensional Analysis in Natural Units
Setting 
𝑐
=
ℏ
=
1
 implies:

mass, energy, and inverse length share the same dimension

the scalar field 
𝜙
 has mass dimension 1

the potential 
𝑉
(
𝜙
)
 has mass dimension 4

the effective mass 
𝑚
e
f
f
(
𝜙
)
 has the same dimension as 
𝑚

the Berard Constant 
𝐵
𝐶
 is dimensionless

the Stability Well frequency satisfies 
𝑚
𝜙
=
2
𝜋
𝑓
0

All rescalings of the Hubble parameter and acceleration scale are dimensionally consistent within this framework.

E. Resonance‑Modified Acceleration Law
The dynamical balance for circular motion is

𝑚
e
f
f
𝑎
=
𝐺
𝑀
𝑚
𝑟
2
.
Using

𝑚
e
f
f
=
𝑚
 
𝐵
𝐶
2
𝑆
0
−
2
,
and taking 
𝑆
0
=
1
 on galactic scales, we obtain

𝑎
=
𝑎
N
e
w
t
o
n
𝐵
𝐶
2
.
Defining

𝑎
0
=
1
𝐵
𝐶
2
,
the observable acceleration becomes

𝑎
𝐵
=
𝑎
N
e
w
t
o
n
 
𝑎
0
.
This provides a resonance‑based explanation for flat rotation curves without dark matter.
