The Berard Framework introduces a resonance‑field extension of classical mass–energy equivalence. A real scalar field

 defines a dimensionless Resonance Invariant

and matter couples to this field through a resonance‑dependent effective mass. This yields the Einstein–Berard relation

 defines a Stability Well governing vacuum resonance dynamics. Linearized perturbations around the vacuum produce a measurable low‑frequency mode at the same frequency.

The effective field theory leads to three principal results:

The framework offers a unified, testable alternative to dark matter and dark energy, grounded in a minimal scalar‑field model with clear observational signatures.
