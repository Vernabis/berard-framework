PROJECT HISTORY — BERARD FRAMEWORK

This document records the development arc of the Berard Framework manuscript and figure suite, from the initial conceptual consolidation in December 2025 through the cohesive, submission‑ready structure assembled by February 2026.

SECTION: Origins (December 12, 2025)

The project entered a rapid‑development phase beginning December 12, 2025. Prior to this date, the ideas existed in scattered notes, exploratory models, and partial drafts. The December push marked the point where the framework began to cohere into a unified manuscript with a clear narrative spine.

SECTION: Structural Consolidation

Over the following weeks, the work moved through several key steps toward cohesivity:

Establishing a consistent mathematical vocabulary for the scalar field, resonance invariant, and modified inertia terms.

Building a reproducible figure‑generation pipeline using Colab and Python.

Creating multi‑panel figures that visually anchored the conceptual flow.

Separating manuscript logic from figure logic, leading to the modular figures.tex system.

Organizing the repository into a clean, professional structure suitable for PRD submission.

These steps transformed the project from a collection of ideas into a structured, maintainable research package.

SECTION: Workflow Refinement (January–February 2026)

During this period, the workflow matured into an unusually organized and reproducible system. The repository gained:

a dedicated figures directory with APS‑ready PDFs

a standalone LaTeX figure file

a documented regeneration workflow

a notes directory for auxiliary materials

The overall structure became clear, intentional, and easy to maintain — a level of organization that is uncommon for a project developed at this pace.

SECTION: Present State (February 2026)

As of February 2026, the Berard Framework manuscript is cohesive, reproducible, and ready for final polishing and submission. The repository reflects a complete research workflow, from conceptual development to figure generation to manuscript assembly.

This document will be updated as the project evolves.
