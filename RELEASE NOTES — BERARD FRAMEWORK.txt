RELEASE NOTES — BERARD FRAMEWORK

This document summarizes major updates and structural milestones in the development of the Berard Framework repository. It is not a detailed changelog, but a high‑level record of meaningful releases and transitions.

SECTION: Initial Consolidation (December 2025)

Core concepts of the Berard Framework unified into a single manuscript structure

Early figure prototypes created for stability wells, oscillations, and effective mass scaling

Repository initialized with basic manuscript files and exploratory code

Beginning of the December–February rapid development phase

This marks the point where the project shifted from scattered notes to a coherent research effort.

SECTION: Figure Pipeline Establishment (Late December 2025)

Colab‑based Python workflow created for reproducible figure generation

Multi‑panel figures standardized into APS‑ready vector PDFs

Initial separation of manuscript content from figure code

Early directory structure established

This release laid the foundation for reproducibility and modularity.

SECTION: Structural Overhaul (January 2026)

Full modular architecture implemented

figures/ directory populated with final‑format PDFs

figures.tex created to centralize all figure environments and captions

Manuscript cleaned and reorganized for clarity

Notes directory introduced for auxiliary documentation

This release transformed the repository into a clean, maintainable research package.

SECTION: Documentation Expansion (Late January 2026)

Project history, methodology note, design philosophy, and technical workflow added

Contact information added for collaborator accessibility

Repository navigation improved through consistent naming and directory structure

Internal logic of the project made explicit through plain‑text documentation

This release improved transparency and long‑term usability.

SECTION: Pre‑Submission Stabilization (February 2026)

Final figure suite regenerated and verified

Manuscript synchronized with all figures and captions

Notes folder expanded with roadmap and architecture overview

Repository validated for intuitive navigation and reproducibility

This release represents the project in its current, submission‑ready state.

SECTION: Future Releases

Future updates may include:

extended parameter studies

additional diagnostics or appendices

public‑facing documentation
