The Berard Framework: A Resonance‑Field Extension of Mass–Energy Equivalence
Author: Vernon Arthur Berard
Date: February 2026

We thank the referee for their careful reading of the manuscript and for the constructive comments.
Below we respond to each point in turn. For clarity, the referee’s comments are reproduced in italics,
followed by our responses in plain text. All changes referenced below have been incorporated into the
revised manuscript.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. *Comment on the origin of the Hubble‑parameter correction.*

We appreciate the referee’s request for clarification. The resonance‑based correction to the Hubble
parameter arises directly from the φ‑dependent effective mass defined in Eq. (12). As shown in
Eqs. (23)–(27), the effective matter density entering the Friedmann equation is rescaled by a factor
of BC² in a homogeneous vacuum with S₀ = 1. This leads to the corrected expansion rate

    H_B = H_obs / BC,

as stated in Eq. (28). We have added a brief explanatory sentence in Sec. VI A to emphasize that the
correction originates from the inertial sector rather than a modification of the gravitational field
equations.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. *Comment on the dimensional consistency of the acceleration law.*

We thank the referee for raising this point. The acceleration law is derived directly from the modified
inertial mass in Eq. (12). As shown in Eqs. (31)–(35), the dynamical balance

    m_eff a = GMm / r²

yields

    a = a_Newton / BC²,

which is dimensionally consistent in natural units (c = ħ = 1). Appendix D has been added to explicitly
document the dimensional analysis and confirm consistency across all equations.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. *Comment on the physical interpretation of the 0.10 Hz Stability Well.*

We agree that the physical role of the 0.10 Hz Stability Well benefits from further clarification.
Appendix B now provides a full linearized perturbation analysis, showing that small deviations from
the vacuum satisfy

    □ δφ + m_φ² δφ = 0,

with m_φ = 2π f₀. This establishes the Stability Well as a genuine small‑oscillation mode of the
resonance field, not an imposed phenomenological parameter.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. *Comment on the relation to modified gravity and MOND‑like theories.*

We thank the referee for this insightful question. The framework presented here is a modified‑inertia
model derived from a scalar‑field effective theory, rather than a modification of the gravitational
field equations. The distinction is now stated explicitly in Sec. VI B. The resulting acceleration law
resembles MOND phenomenology, but arises from a different mechanism: a resonance‑induced rescaling
of inertial mass rather than a modification of Newtonian gravity or the Einstein equations.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. *Comment on observational testability.*

We agree that highlighting observational signatures strengthens the manuscript. The Conclusion now
emphasizes three concrete tests:

1. A 0.10 Hz vacuum resonance detectable in precision timing experiments.
2. A rescaled Hubble parameter differing from ΛCDM by a factor 1/BC.
3. A resonance‑based acceleration scale that predicts flat rotation curves without dark matter.

These signatures provide clear avenues for empirical evaluation.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. *Comment on notation consistency.*

We thank the referee for noting minor inconsistencies. The notation has been standardized throughout:

• S₀ is consistently used for the Resonance Invariant.  
• H_B denotes the resonance‑corrected Hubble parameter.  
• a_B denotes the resonance‑modified acceleration.  
• All equations referenced in the text now carry labels.  

These changes improve clarity without altering the underlying physics.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. *General comment on clarity and organization.*

We appreciate the referee’s positive remarks regarding the conceptual structure. In response to the
suggestion for improved readability, we have:

• smoothed transitions between sections,  
• tightened the abstract,  
• expanded the Conclusion, and  
• added Appendices A–D for technical completeness.

We believe these revisions significantly enhance the manuscript’s clarity and accessibility.

------------------------------------------------------------

We thank the referee again for their thoughtful comments and believe the manuscript has been
substantially improved as a result.
