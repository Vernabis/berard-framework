Executive Summary  
The Berard Framework: A Resonance‑Field Extension of Mass–Energy Equivalence  
Author: Vernon Arthur Berard
Date: February 2026

Purpose of the Framework
The Berard Framework introduces a resonance‑field interpretation of mass–energy equivalence. A real scalar field 
𝜙
(
𝑥
)
 defines a dimensionless Resonance Invariant

𝑆
0
=
𝜙
𝜙
0
,
and matter couples to this field through a resonance‑dependent effective mass. This leads to a modified inertial sector, a corrected cosmological expansion rate, and a natural galactic acceleration scale — all derived from a minimal effective field theory.

The framework provides a unified explanation for several large‑scale anomalies without invoking non‑baryonic dark matter or dark energy.

Key Results
1. Modified Inertial Energy
The effective mass depends on the resonance field, altering inertial response while leaving gravitational dynamics unchanged.

2. Hubble‑Parameter Correction
In a homogeneous vacuum with 
𝑆
0
=
1
, the matter energy density is rescaled:

𝜌

f

𝐵

.
This leads to a corrected expansion rate:

This provides a resonance‑based explanation for the Hubble tension.

3. Natural Galactic Acceleration Scale

and defining

This produces flat rotation curves without dark matter.

Summary
The Berard Framework provides a mathematically consistent, observationally testable extension of classical mass–energy equivalence. By introducing a resonance‑dependent inertial sector, the model offers unified explanations for the Hubble tension, galactic rotation curves, and vacuum‑scale oscillations — all derived from a minimal scalar‑field theory.
