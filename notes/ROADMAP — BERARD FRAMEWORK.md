ROADMAP — BERARD FRAMEWORK

This document outlines the planned future development of the Berard Framework project. It is not a strict schedule, but a structured overview of the next logical phases of refinement, expansion, and long‑term maintenance.

SECTION: Phase 1 — Manuscript Finalization (Current)

Complete final polishing of the RevTeX manuscript

Ensure all equations are consistently formatted

Verify that all figures match the narrative and variable definitions

Perform a final pass on captions and cross‑references

Prepare the submission package for PRD and arXiv

This phase focuses on stability and clarity rather than new content.

SECTION: Phase 2 — Extended Analysis (Post‑Submission)

After initial submission, the project may expand to include:

deeper exploration of parameter space

additional stability analyses

extended discussion of physical implications

optional appendices for derivations or alternative formulations

These additions are not required for the core manuscript but may strengthen follow‑up work.

SECTION: Phase 3 — Public Release and Documentation

If the project is made public, the following steps will support accessibility:

expanded README with conceptual overview

annotated figure‑generation notebook

optional tutorial or walkthrough for new readers

improved comments in the Python scripts

The goal is to make the framework approachable without diluting its rigor.

SECTION: Phase 4 — Collaboration and Feedback Integration

As feedback arrives from peers or referees, the project may evolve through:

clarifications in the manuscript

additional figures or diagnostics

refinements to the theoretical narrative

adjustments to notation or terminology

This phase is iterative and depends on external input.

SECTION: Phase 5 — Long‑Term Maintenance

To ensure the project remains usable over time:

keep the figure‑generation workflow compatible with future Python/Colab environments

maintain the notes directory as a living record

update the roadmap as phases are completed

preserve the modular structure of the repository

The goal is to keep the project coherent and reproducible for years to come.
